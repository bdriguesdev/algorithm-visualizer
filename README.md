# üíª Algorithm Visualizer
Demo: https://algorithmvisualizerbdrigues.netlify.com/ <br>
Algorithm visualizer is a project with the objective to put together my knowledge in Frontend and algorithms/data structure, two ‚Äúareas‚Äù that I have a great interest in. The website can simulate, with animations, how the algorithm works, including sorting algorithms and search in a graph.

```
npm install
```
<br><br>

```
npm start
```
Runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.
<br><br>

```
npm run build
```
Builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!
